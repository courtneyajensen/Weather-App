URL: https://courtneyajensen.github.io/Weather-App/

Description: This app allows users to search for a 5 day forecast for different cities. The app uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The app uses OpenWeather API to retrieve the weather data.

User Story: As a traveler I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

Usage: The application is used in the browser and allows the user to use the search bar to search for different cities. Using local storage past cities that have been searched appear below the search bar. The current city being searched will appear off to the right hand side to display the current weather and a 5 day forecast below that. The user has the ability to clear recent searches using the 'clear' button which is located just underneath the search bar.
